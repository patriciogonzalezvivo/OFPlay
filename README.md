Borns as a Major Studio project after a [brief research](http://www.patriciogonzalezvivo.com/blog/?p=821) exploring the difficult learning process of openFrameworks.

The aesthetic have been delivery chosen to reinforce the metaphor of openFrameworks as a kit of building blocks. For that I was inspired on Froebel's gifts toys.
